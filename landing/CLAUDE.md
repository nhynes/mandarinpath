This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the MandarinPath landing page.

## Project Overview

## Development Commands

**Essential Commands:**
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server at localhost:4321
- `pnpm build` - Build production site (includes type checking)
- `pnpm lint` - Run prettier check and Astro type checking
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Auto-fix formatting issues with prettier
- `pnpm check` or `pnpm type-check` - Run Astro type checking only
